<p><b>Bicycle Colorado + USA Cycling + WeRaceHere = Great Racing in 2023!</b></p>
<p>This year, we are piloting a new shared-membership model with USA Cycling. This means that your Racing Membership at Bicycle Colorado is included with your 2023 USA Cycling Racing Membership! When you activate your account at WeRaceHere, we will validate your Racing Membership with Bicycle Colorado. The Bicycle Colorado Racing Membership is similar to the memberships sold in the past by the Bicycle Racing Association of Colorado to support the organization that works to structure, sustain and improve local cycling events—and now that’s us!</p>
